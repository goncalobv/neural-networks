Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning in Neural Networks
=====================================================

This repository includes the descriptions, implementations and reports for the projects of the Neural Networks class.

The Kohonen project consists of using Kohonen maps for clustering (unsupervised learning) and classification of handwritten digits (MNIST dataset). Implemented in MATLAB.

The Gridworld project consists of training a neural network using SARSA algorithm (reinforcement learning) for the Morris water-maze task. Implemented in Python.
